# Non-vicous-potential-flow-analysis

This codes develops a flow analyais using the potential theory which simplifies the Navier-Stokes stokes euqations 
in order to obtain a valid result for certain cituation where the visocity is not important.

The code structure is described in the following image:

Some of the results you should get when runing the code are:
